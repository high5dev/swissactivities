Four official languages are spoken on a mere 40,000 square kilometres and the climate varies between arctic cold in winter and Mediterranean warmth in summer. With over 1,500 lakes, Switzerland is considered the water castle of Europe and the Alps make up over 50% of the land mass. If you've ever started your day on the Rhine in Basel and ended it on Lake Maggiore in Ticino, you know that a three-hour train ride in Switzerland can transport you to another world. Let us take you to all corners of this diverse country and introduce you to the sights, destinations and our Swiss Activities tips."

Four official languages are spoken on a mere 40,000 square kilometres and the climate varies between arctic cold in winter and Mediterranean warmth in summer. With over 1,500 lakes, Switzerland is considered the water castle of Europe and the Alps make up over 50% of the land mass. If you've ever started your day on the Rhine in Basel and ended it on Lake Maggiore in Ticino, you know that a three-hour train ride in Switzerland can transport you to another world. Let us take you to all corners of this diverse country and introduce you to the sights, destinations and our Swiss Activities tips.",

The Swiss Activities travel guides bring you closer to all aspects of Switzerland - starting with the breathtaking Jungfrau Railway and ending with a visit to the Museum of Transport in Lucerne.",
